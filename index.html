          <h2><h2>Health Risks as Functions of Age and Income</h2>
          <p>Age as index of Health:
            Obesity: Obesity has high incidence among persons age 20 to 40 years; incidence is lower among age <20 years and >40 years.
            Smoking: The median age of smokersâ€™ range between 13 and 28 years across US states. Smokers tend to be younger in UT and CA, older in WY and KY.
            Possession of Health Insurance: Lower % of persons with median age 32 to 45 years lack health insurance in MA and VT; median age is 21% in GA and 25% in TX.</p>

            <p>Poverty Vs Health Insurance:
              Poverty index appears to be roughly correlated with possession of health insurance: lower poverty rate and lowest proportion of
              persons having health insurance are observable in MA; highest in MS. 25% of persons in about 18% poverty bracket lack health insurance in TX.</p>
            </p>

            Lower % of persons with household income in the range 40,000 to 75,000 p.a. lack health insurance in MA, VT and MN respectively. Up to 20%
            lack health insurance in LA, MS, GA. The % is highest in TX.</p>
